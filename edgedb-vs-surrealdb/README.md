# EdgeDB vs SurrealDB

## Usecase

Scrape the followers of [Rawkode Academy](https://github.com/orgs/RawkodeAcademy/followers) and their starred repos.
Use the "Languages" of each repo to add tags and store them in a database.
Create a small web app to show the repos based on the tags.

One project uses EdgeDB, the other uses SurrealDB to store the data.
